Fixed an issue where changing the `sync_timeout` parameter for Pulsar producer action would not have the expected effect on request timeout.

Deprecated `resource_opts.request_ttl` configuration for Pulsar producer action.  It did not affect the request TTL as expected (`retention_period` does) and thus could confuse users.
