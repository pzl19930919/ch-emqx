  _Wildcard-optimized_ layout is designed to maximize the throughput of wildcard subscriptions covering large numbers of topics.

  For example, it can handle scenarios where a very large number of clients publish data to the topics containing their client ID, such as: `sensor/%device-version%/%clientid%/temperature`, `sensor/%device-version%/%clientid%/pressure`, etc.
  This layout will automatically group such topics into a single stream, so a client subscribing to a topic filter containing wildcards (such as `sensor/+/+/temperature`) will be able to consume messages published by all devices as a single batch.

  This layout is efficient for non-wildcard subscriptions as well.~"""

  Reading messages from a single epoch can be done very efficiently, so larger epochs improve the throughput of subscribers, but may increase end-to-end latency.

  Time span covered by each epoch grows exponentially with the value of `epoch_bits`:

  - `epoch_bits = 1`: epoch time = 1 millisecond
